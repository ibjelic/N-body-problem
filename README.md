# N-body-problem
Gravity simulation


C# project that i did as my project at my University.

Its 2D system where you can add round bodies to specific coordinates, with starting velocities (Vx,Vy) and mass;
You can load them from txt files (There are 2 examples tela.txt, tela2.txt);
Also you can set what will 1 pixel represent in meters and you can define constant of force (For example 6E-11 gravity constant);
